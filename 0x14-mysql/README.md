0. Install MySQL
First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
Please make sure you have your README.md pushed to GitHub.
1. Let us in!
In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
In addition to that, make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. You will likely need to add the public key to web-02 as you only added it to web-01 for this project. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status

5. MySQL backup
What if the data center where both your primary and replica database servers are hosted are down because of a power outage or even worse: flooding, fire? Then all your data would inaccessible or lost. That’s why you want to backup and store them in a different system in another physical location. This can be achieved by dumping your MySQL data, compressing them and storing them in a different data center.

Write a Bash script that generates a MySQL dump and creates a compressed archive out of it.

Requirements:

The MySQL dump must contain all your MySQL databases
The MySQL dump must be named backup.sql
The MySQL dump file has to be compressed to a tar.gz archive
This archive must have the following name format: day-month-year.tar.gz
The user to connect to the MySQL database must be root
The Bash script accepts one argument that is the password used to connect to the MySQL database
